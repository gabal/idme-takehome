# Take Home Interview Exercise Gabriel Balda

## Getting Started

First, install node modules:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

## Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Run Tests
```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

## Create a New Component Using Template
```bash
npm run generate
# or
yarn generate
# or
pnpm generate
```

## Possible improvements
- Increase unit test coverage
- Add Cypress tests (at least for responsive design)
- Improve responsive padding
- Implement Options menu or hide the column
- Create/Implement designs for loading and error pages


## Questions
- Can we have the categories colors as a separate service or should we expand the constant with categories
- Is the first empty column required (based on designs, probabloy for future multiple selection) or can we replace it with just a special padding for first column
- Can we rely in the HTMl content show in description
